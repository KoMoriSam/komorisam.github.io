## Environment Variables

The project currently relies on these Vite environment variables:

```bash
VITE_API_ARTICLE_URL=
VITE_API_NOVEL_URL=
VITE_SERVER_ADDRESS=
VITE_MXNZP_APP_ID=
VITE_MXNZP_APP_SECRET=
VITE_HOMEPAGE_URL=
```

What they are used for:

- VITE_API_ARTICLE_URL: article index and Markdown source
- VITE_API_NOVEL_URL: novel chapter index and content source
- VITE_SERVER_ADDRESS: default server address shown on the homepage
- VITE_MXNZP_APP_ID / VITE_MXNZP_APP_SECRET: credentials for the daily quote API
- VITE_HOMEPAGE_URL: site base URL used by theme-related assets

If you want to use only local static content, make sure the article and novel API URLs point to the corresponding static directories or a local proxy.
